# Bad code

Implements a api endpoint for a calculator. 

- Used the springboot.io starter for the REST API backend
- Used vue for frontend

Since i was sick with covid during this assignment, the code is not done with much care. 

I did not change the demo names of classes and method. All is just modified to get the task passed with minimal effort

- Calculator: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
- API: http://localhost:8080/greeting
	- Returns: {"id":1,"content":"4.0"}
- API Param: http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=4%2B2
	- Returns: {"id":2,"content":"6.0"}
